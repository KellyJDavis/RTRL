# RTRL

*RTRL* is a [CUDA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA) based implementation of the real time recurrent learning algorithm as first described by [Ronald J. Williams](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/rjw/) and [David Zipser](http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~zipser/) in *[A Learning Algorithm for Continually Running Fully Recurrent Neural Networks](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/neco.1989.1.2.270#.VV2rBaKX2Aw)*.
